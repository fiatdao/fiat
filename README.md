```sh
# User must be in sudoers
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Run this or login again to use Nix
. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh"
```

### Install DappTools (for debugging only)
```sh
nix-env -f https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/archive/f9ff55e11100b14cd595d8c15789d8407124b349.tar.gz -iA dapp hevm seth ethsign
